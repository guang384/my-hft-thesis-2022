That &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
Now , where do you find such Goldilocks conditions ?
But of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
Each rung contains information .
I was not an activist .
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
This is a family portrait .
&quot; &quot; We have no freedom , &quot; &quot; they said .
When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
This young child is eight years old .
Many of them drown .
All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .

And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
Thank you very much .
In an age of global strife and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is sex so damn good ?
If you &apos;re laughing , you know what I mean .
Here &apos;s why . Back in university , we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks .
Here &apos;s my clock .
It uses something called the dwarf sunflower , which grows to about 12 inches in height .
Now , as you know , sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day .
So in the morning , you see which direction the sunflower is facing , and you mark it on the blank area in the base .
At noon , you mark the changed position of the sunflower , and in the evening again , and that &apos;s your clock .
Now , I know my clock doesn &apos;t tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower .
So , in my completely unbiased , subjective opinion , it &apos;s brilliant .
However , here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
It &apos;s five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one .
In each shot glass is a different scented oil .
In the morning , the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass , focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath .
This will warm up the scented oil inside , and a particular smell will be emitted .
So during the course of the day , five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment .
Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
You can see why I hate Chris .
One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
This problem &apos;s been bugging me for well over a decade .
All right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why sex is so good .
Many years after the solar powered clocks project , a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses .
And when she said this , I had an epiphany .
So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses .
To do this , I devised something called the five senses graph .
Along the y-axis , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x-axis , you have , of course , the five senses .
Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life , I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary .
Here &apos;s a quick video to show you how it works .
Bike designer : This is &#91; unclear &#93; , custom bike designer .
( Motorcyle revving ) &#91; Sound &#93; &#91; Touch &#93; &#91; Sight &#93; &#91; Smell &#93; &#91; Taste &#93; JL : And that &apos;s how the five senses graph works .
So here are some other results .
The first is for instant noodles .
Now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
You know . ( Slurps ) Needless to say , I no longer dine with these people .
OK , next , clubbing .
These people I still do hang out with .
All right , and smoking .
Here I found touch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers .
OK . Now , what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph ?
It would , of course , be a horizontal line along the top .
Now you can see , not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close .
In fact , in the years that I gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
That is , of course , sex . Great sex .
Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good .
Now in the middle of all this five senses work , I suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth .
And I realized this theory also explains why Chris &apos;s clock is so much better than mine .
You see , my clock only focuses on sight , and a little bit of touch .
Here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
It &apos;s the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
In fact , in terms of the five senses , Chris &apos;s clock is a revolution .
And that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
You see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ignored the other three senses .
Chris &apos;s clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product .
So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs ?
Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
We could call this &quot; &quot; the perfumator . &quot; &quot; All right , next .
So I brush my teeth twice a day , and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy , and when the taste of candy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your toothbrush ?
Finally , I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet .
It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you press down on them .
Now , I don &apos;t play the flute or the clarinet , so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play : the television remote control .
Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
Now , I realize the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
There &apos;s also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor .
Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk .
Until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
Oh , one last thing before I leave .
And the best way to do that is with free candy .
You guys ready ?
All right .
( Applause )
What could go wrong ?
But I don &apos;t know who felt worse that day .
And without the humor .
That &apos;s one version .
And I didn &apos;t make this up , I did write that letter .
You get the idea .
I jumped on it , because that was where Bill Gates lived , right ?
I didn &apos;t even start .
It &apos;s not because he didn &apos;t try .
And that rejection hurt me .
So this is where I went online and looked for help .
Google was my friend .
Day One ...
( Arabic ) I seek refuge in Allah from cursed Satan . In the Name of Allah , the most Gracious , the most Merciful .
My mother had 16 pregnancies .
From 16 pregnancies , five of us are alive .
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
Unfortunately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a dormitory for girls , so I was accepted in medical school , but I could not go there .
So as a result , my father sent me to America .
I came to America .
My family was in a refugee camp .
So as soon as I completed my education , I brought my family to America .
I wanted them to be safe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
I had a good job .
About 90 percent of them were women and children . Most of the men have been killed or they were in war . And you know , in the refugee camp ,
when I went day-to-day to do a survey , I found things you never could imagine .
I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no entertainment , no place to even live .
So it was a very devastating situation .
At that moment , we talk about momentum .
At that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?
How could I help these people ?
No , because at that time , education was banned for girls , completely .
It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who am I ?
So I really needed to build the trust in this community .
I went and surveyed and looked and looked .
I asked .
He was 80 years old .
He was a mullah .
one day I was in the office in Peshawar , Pakistan .
They were the ugliest looking men you can ever see .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
By that time , my staff poured into my office .
I am very shaken up , and I told myself , this is it .
There is no doubt in my mind .
That tells you that education transforms people .
But you know what happened to my country .
But we want the same Afghanistan we had before .
They are earning degrees . They are training to be lawyers .
We have one poet , Mawlānā Rūmī .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
They kill our livestock .
This is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
My community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
So I grew up hating lions so much .
The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
So they kill the lions .
It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cowshed .
But lions are very clever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he jumps in and kills the animals .
So one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
So I set up everything .
As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
One of them was this grandmother .
She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
So one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
And here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere : Yep .
CA : You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
RT : My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence.CA : Electric fence ?
RT : But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
( Laughter ) CA : You already tried it once , right , and you — RT : I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock . ( Laughter ) CA : In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
Thank you so much.RT : Thank you . ( Applause )
Server : Would you like any desserts , sir ?
Ideas can spark a movement .
Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
Our magazines are read by millions .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
So I started planning how to help them escape .
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
( Music ) ( Applause )
This is how the rooftop looks .
And why did we design this ?
I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he insisted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof ?
But we could keep that idea around the trees .
And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail .
But of course , rope has nothing to do with them .
And you get more , and more , more .
( Laughter ) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
And also there is no boundary between classrooms .
When you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
But in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous .
Because there is no boundary .
And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go .
He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back .
( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occasion , usually children try to hide somewhere .
But here , just they leave and come back .
It &apos;s a natural process .
You know that children sleep better in noise .
And in this kindergarten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
And you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise .
And you know , you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar .
You know , it &apos;s completely open .
In summer you go swimming .
The sand is 50 degrees .
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they divide classrooms .
They are supposed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A classroom .
And a washbasin .
And there are always some trees in the classroom .
A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
( Laughter ) Monkeys . ( Laughter )
And each classroom has at least one skylight .
And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas .
This is the annex building , right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten .
The building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
And of course , the ceiling height is very low .
So , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
They tried to go in .
He hit his head .
He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
He is resilient . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
And then we put other children .
( Laughter ) The driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
Now these days , kids need a small dosage of danger .
And in this kind of occasion , they learn to help each other .
This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning .
But the surprise is yet to come .
Just like sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep running . ( Laughter )
My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes .
They need to get some injury .
I think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives .
And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
They are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars , but collections of stars , or galaxies .
Now , by showing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects , but more than that , I think galaxy clusters are mysterious , they are surprising , and they &apos;re useful .
Useful as the universe &apos;s most massive laboratories .
And as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
And I think there are four major types , and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big .
So , how big ?
Well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent , it &apos;s being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster .
And , in fact , if you look very carefully you &apos;ll be able to see rings around this cluster .
Now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns .
It &apos;s just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get .
But more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
They are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe .
And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
might be answered by studying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very hot .
Okay , if I take an image of a galaxy cluster , and I subtract away all of the starlight , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blob .
This is in false color .
It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
And the question is , if it &apos;s not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
The answer is hot gas , million-degree gas — in fact , it &apos;s plasma .
And the reason why it &apos;s so hot goes back to the previous slide .
The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds , and great speeds means great temperatures .
So this is the main idea , but science is a rough draft .
There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
Third thing : probing the very small .
Now , to explain this , I need to tell you a very disturbing fact .
Most of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of atoms .
You were lied to .
Most of it is made up of something very , very mysterious , which we call dark matter .
Dark matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we smash things together .
And dark matter is no exception .
Well , how do we do this ?
To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clusters collide ?
Here is an image .
Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe , scaled-down versions .
They are mostly made up of dark matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bluish purple .
The red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
What &apos;s happened is a particle accelerator at a huge , huge scale .
And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab , might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature .
So , it &apos;s very funny .
The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter , the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small , is precisely because they are so very big .
Fourth thing : the physics of the very strange .
Certainly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
Okay , if there &apos;s anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy .
If I throw a ball into the air , I expect it to go up .
What I don &apos;t expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate .
Similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s expanding at an ever-increasing rate .
They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
And , again , we want to learn more about it .
So , one particular question that we have is , how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
Depending on how strong it is , maybe structure forms faster or slower .
Well , the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s horribly complicated .
Here is a computer simulation .
And we need a way to simplify it .
Well , I like to think about this using an analogy .
If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts .
Similarly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies .
So , as I come to a close , you might feel slightly cheated .
I mean , I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful , and I &apos;ve given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars .
He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . &quot; &quot; Today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems .
And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
They are not faster horses .
They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
So , yes , we need to focus , yes , we need to concentrate , but we also need to remember that innovation , ingenuity , inspiration — these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out .
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . Thanks .

Who am I ?
I love animals .
Ten years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
The call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo .
An elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she &apos;d had a stroke .
And this procedure , which I have done on many human patients , was identical , with the exception of that paw and that tail .
And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
Now , I &apos;ve got a confession to make .
Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
When I see a human patient now , I always ask , what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human .
Some animal patients also harm themselves .
But veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin in the mare .
To explain it , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to air some dirty laundry .
But here &apos;s one from the vets : What do you call a veterinarian who can only take care of one species ?
Thank you .
Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
Okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
It was insidious and it was really happening .
Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
Just look at that for a minute .
No adults believed I was serious .
Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
It offers many insights .
A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve invaded .
You probably won &apos;t .
This is a problem we have to solve .
They put it online for free .
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
But with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
And the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
He finds a local sporting team .
He trains with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
For some of us it might be music . For some of us it might be food .
My challenge instead is this .
And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles .
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities .
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
They are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
So I was on a national television prime-time show .
A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .

This back here was my brain cancer .
( Laughter ) The key phrase is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; phew .
I knew nothing about cancer .
And everyone changes as well .
You suddenly become a disease on legs .
Doctors start speaking a language which you don &apos;t understand .
These are the &quot; &quot; Can I ? &quot; &quot; questions : Can I work while I have cancer ?
Can I study ? Can I make love ? Can I be creative ?
And you wonder , &quot; &quot; What have I done to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I change something about my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I do something ?
But instead , you &apos;re forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers .
It was really hard to obtain , because it &apos;s not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer .
I &apos;m an artist , I use several forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice .
I actually had to hack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another speech .
I was interested in the social cure , I was interested in the psychological cure , I was interested in the spiritual cure , I was interested in the emotional cure , I was interested in any form of cure .
And , it worked .
The La Cura website went viral .
For example , here we see Francesca Fini in her performance .
Now you can have my cancer , too !
( Laughter ) Which is a nice thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer .
And together , we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages , according to many cultures .
And the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite remarkable for me .
So I was able to take my time and choose .
Everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well , and this was the most important part of La Cura .
What are the outcomes ?
I &apos;m fine , as you can see , pretty fine .
I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle .
Everything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged .
Obviously , there were .
Thousands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer .
And from what I feel , it &apos;s a cure for me , but for us all .
Thank you .

A big challenge is , how should the iPads be used , and what apps should we put on the iPads ?
Hi everybody . So my name is Mac .
It was going to be the highlight of our store .
Mammoth Chunks . These things weigh , like , seven pounds each .
And so I try to do this in my books .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
This market &apos;s crazy , everybody .
Mac Barnett : So Nico called back , like , an hour later .
But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression , but a lasting one that remains .
I was born in a family full of colors .
My father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone .
He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents .
The matriarch , my grandma , has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair .
My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone , like my uncle and my cousin .
My mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native Brazilian , with a pinch of hazel and honey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mix of coffee with milk , but with a lot of coffee .
She has two sisters .
One in a toasted-peanut skin and the other , also adopted , more on the beige side , like a pancake .
Outside home , however , things were different soon .
Color had many other meanings .
I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings .
It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil .
I was made of flesh but I wasn &apos;t pink .
My skin was brown , and people said I was black .
I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head .
Later , when I took my cousin to school , I was usually taken for the nanny .
By helping in the kitchen at a friend &apos;s party , people thought I was the maid .
And many times , visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings , I was invited not to use the main elevator .
In some way , I get to used to it and accept part of it .
However , something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling .
Years later I married a Spaniard .
But not any Spaniard .
I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt .
( Laughter ) Since then , a new question started to chase me .
What will be the color of your children ?
As you can understand , this is my last concern .
But thinking about it , with my previous background , my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer .
And that is how Humanae was born .
Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors , rather than the untrue white , red , black or yellow associated with race .
It &apos;s a kind of game to question our codes .
It &apos;s a work in progress from a personal story to a global history .
I portray the subjects in a white background .
Then I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose , paint the background , and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette , Pantone .
I started with my family and friends , then more and more people joined the adventure , thanks to public calls coming through the social media .
I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain .
The snowball started to roll .
The project had a great welcome — invitations , exhibitions , physical formats , galleries and museums ...
just happened .
And among them , my favorite : when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street , it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community .
I have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries , 19 different cities around the world .
Just to mention some of them — from someone included in the Forbes list , to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat .
In Paris , from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter .
And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro .
All kinds of beliefs , gender identities or physical impairments , a newborn or terminally ill .
We all together build Humanae .
Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other .
When modern science is questioning the race concept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , yellow , red ?
Is it the eye , the nose , the mouth , the hair ?
This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery .
Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people .
It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label .
It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me .
So your work has a very special place in my heart and it &apos;s very important for me . &quot; &quot; A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote , &quot; &quot; All my life , people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group , a stereotype , a box .
Perhaps we should stop .
Instead of framing , ask the individual , &apos; How would you label yourself ? &apos; Then I would say , &apos; Hi . I &apos;m Massiel .
I &apos;m a Dominican-Dutch , I grew up in a mixed family and I &apos;m a bisexual woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; Besides these unexpected and touching reactions , Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields .
It &apos;s a collection of faces .
Researchers in the fields of anthropology , physics and neuroscience use Humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity , optophysiology , face recognition or Alzheimer &apos;s .
One of the most important impacts of the project is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs , one of the most relevant political publications .
And talking about foreign affairs , I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ...
teachers .
They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes .
Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes , but this time as a teacher myself .
My students , both adults and kids , paint their self-portraits , trying to discover their own unique color .
As a photographer , I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate .
As an individual , as Angélica , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist .
becomes love .
The last country — the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where I was born , Brazil .
We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination .
That remains a common practice worldwide , and that will not disappear by itself .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running .
I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my superintendent .
Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County , Virginia , the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains .
I was a young man , and I had been dropping in and out of college .
It was an experimental education program .
I am one of her teaching gestures .
It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoulders of many people .
And it has four Plexiglass layers .
There &apos;s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining .
( Video ) Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
And the Defense Minister — she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth .
That &apos;s a breach there .
Had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it .
I could not have designed that in teaching it .
By the third sentence , she was in tears .
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
Every game we play is different .
Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
Some games are more about warfare .
If only .
( Applause )
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
People have very different aptitudes .
Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government &apos;s chief scientific adviser during the war .
You were able to deliver documents , were able to do it over networks .
And the third is commitment .
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
So , you know , there &apos;s bars . And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something — a movie , an album , a song or a book — and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?
So , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I teach high school math .
I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
So there &apos;s a useful stereotype about students that I see , a useful stereotype about you all .
I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
This stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . Math reasoning — we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach .
This is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a calamity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
So first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-start .
You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks .
Students lack perseverance .
They lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
There &apos;s an aversion to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students .
And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
This is really destructive .
David Milch , creator of &quot; &quot; Deadwood &quot; &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good description for this .
He swore off creating contemporary drama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men , &quot; &quot; no disrespect , it shapes the neural pathways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems .
He called it , &quot; &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track .
And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to retire in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way .
I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our textbooks — particularly mass-adopted textbooks — teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functionally equivalent to turning on &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men &quot; &quot; and calling it a day .
( Laughter ) In all seriousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics textbook .
It applies equally to math .
Notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
I believe in real life .
And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have sufficient information and had to go find some .
I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
And the textbook , I think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit .
And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stamp this was molded from , it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula .
You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . That &apos;s a shame .
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
You also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing .
You have substeps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steepest .
So I hope you can see .
I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we &apos;re paving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way .
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the steepest ?
And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers .
So you get people arguing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journaling , whatever .
And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D labels to talk about them more easily .
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
The math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing .
But if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together .
Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
And I &apos;ll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues .
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t involve them in the formulation of the problem .
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
First things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
Students need to decide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the height matter ? Does the side of it matter ?
Does the color of the valve matter ? What matters here ? &quot; &quot; Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
So now we have a water tank .
How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it .
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
It &apos;s tedious .
Students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve baited the hook , right ?
And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , I teach kids — because of my inexperience — I teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ?
And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it .
But here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition .
Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .
We put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here .
And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edition .
We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
These are the kids who now , one semester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
We &apos;re no longer averse to word problems , because we &apos;ve redefined what a word problem is .
We &apos;re no longer intimidated by math , because we &apos;re slowly redefining what math is .
This has been a lot of fun .
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful .
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
It &apos;s ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous .
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that .
Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wow .
I put this problem on my blog recently : In a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items .
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; &quot; Good Morning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
And from all of this , I can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this .
Math makes sense of the world .
Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
So I just really encourage you , whatever your stake is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever — insist on better math curriculum .
We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you . ( Applause )
It means to play softly .
If you &apos;re playing a musical instrument and you notice a &quot; &quot; p &quot; &quot; in the score , you need to play softer .
Four p &apos;s — extremely soft .
So it has a history of about 200 years .
I was born deaf , and I was taught to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life .
And I believed it to be true .
Yet , I realize now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all .
Sound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day .
As a Deaf person living in a world of sound , it &apos;s as if I was living in a foreign country , blindly following its rules , customs , behaviors and norms without ever questioning them .
So how is it that I understand sound ?
Well , I watch how people behave and respond to sound .
You people are like my loudspeakers , and amplify sound .
I learn and mirror that behavior .
Thus I &apos;ve learned , for example ...
&quot; Don &apos;t make too much noise when you &apos;re eating from the potato-chip bag ! &quot;
I &apos;m hyper-vigilant around sound .
And I &apos;m always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound , about what &apos;s to come next .
TBD , to be decided .
TBC , to be continued .
TBA , to be announced .
In Deaf culture , movement is equivalent to sound .
This is a sign for &quot; &quot; staff &quot; &quot; in ASL .
Yet for me , signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn &apos;t feel natural .
In the year 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin , Germany , for an artist residency there .
Prior to this time , I had been working as a painter .
At that time , sound was trending , and this struck me ...
there was no visual art , everything was auditory .
Now sound has come into my art territory .
Is it going to further distance me from art ?
I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
I actually know sound .
It could be felt tactually , or experienced as a visual , or even as an idea .
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice .
And everything that I had been taught regarding sound , I decided to do away with and unlearn .
I started creating a new body of work .
And when I presented this to the art community , I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received .
I realized : sound is like money , power , control — social currency .
In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a hearing person &apos;s thing .
And sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork , or it could empower me .
I chose to be empowered .
There &apos;s a massive culture around spoken language .
And just because I don &apos;t use my literal voice to communicate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a voice at all .
So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice .
And that way , I &apos;m able to maintain relevancy in society today .
So at school , at work and institutions , I work with many different ASL interpreters .
And their voice becomes my voice and identity .
They help me to be heard .
And their voices hold value and currency .
So with sound as my new art medium , I delved into the world of music .
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL .
For example , a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper .
And the same holds true for a concept in ASL .
ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters .
However , ASL is more like a chord — all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in ASL .
If just one of those keys were to change the chord , it would create a completely different meaning .
In ASL , by playing around with these different grammatical parameters , you can express different ideas .
For example , take the sign TO-LOOK-AT .
This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT .
I &apos;m looking at you .
Uh-oh .
What are you looking at ?
Aw , stop .
If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over , it could become like a piece of visual music .
For example , this is the sign for &quot; &quot; day , &quot; &quot; as the sun rises and sets .
All ... day .
This is ALL-NIGHT , represented in this drawing .
We have the staff across the head and the chest .
Everybody , hands up .
Yes , got it .
That means &quot; &quot; to fall in love &quot; &quot; in International &#91; Sign &#93; .
The second one I &apos;d like to demonstrate is this — please follow along with me again .
And now this .
This is &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; &quot; in ASL .
And again .
This is &quot; &quot; enlightenment &quot; &quot; in ASL .
So let &apos;s do all three together .
&quot; Fall in love , &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; and &quot; &quot; enlightenment . &quot; &quot; Good job , everyone .
However , in this day and age , we live in a very audio-centric world .
We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency — without sound .
And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society .
And maybe people will understand that you don &apos;t need to be deaf to learn ASL , nor do you have to be hearing to learn music .
ASL is such a rich treasure that I &apos;d like you to have the same experience .
And I &apos;d like to invite you to open your ears , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our visual language .
And you never know , you might just fall in love with us .
( Applause ) Thank you .
It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
But then the great famine began in 1994 .
I was four years old .
My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after midnight .
I would wander the streets searching for food , and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother &apos;s back eating chips , and wanting to steal them from him .
Hunger is humiliation . Hunger is hopelessness .
For a hungry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
On my ninth birthday , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to eat .
But even as a child , I could feel the heaviness in their hearts .
Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time , and in 2003 , when I was 13 years old , my father became one of them .
I saw my father wither away and die .
In the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
Since we had never been separated , and I thought we would be together forever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hug when she left .
It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life .
But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long goodbye .
I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
Suddenly , I became an orphan and homeless .
My daily life became very hard , but very simple .
My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash .
But that is no way to survive .
I started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
Sometimes , I found small jobs in exchange for food .
Once , I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine , 33 meters underground without any protection for up to 16 hours a day .
I was not uncommon .
Many other orphans survived this way , or worse .
When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains , I hoped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
That hope kept me alive .
I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread , even though it usually didn &apos;t .
But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die .
Hope kept me alive .
Every day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live .
After three years of waiting for my sister &apos;s return , I decided to go to China to look for her myself .
I realized I couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
I knew the journey would be risky , but I would be risking my life either way .
I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea , or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China .
I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen .
North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission .
Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans , where they face severe punishment .
I decided to cross during the day , first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
I made it to China on February 15 , 2006 .
I was 16 years old .
I thought things in China would be easier , since there was more food .
I thought more people would help me .
But it was harder than living in North Korea , because I was not free .
I was always worried about being caught and sent back .
By a miracle , some months later , I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans , and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years .
Later that year , an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee .
I went to America without knowing a word of English , yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school .
Even in North Korea , I was an F student .
( Laughter ) And I barely finished elementary school .
And I remember I fought in school more than once a day .
Textbooks and the library were not my playground .
My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
At one point , my father gave up on me .
He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hurt me deeply .
But nevertheless , my level of motivation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
So in America , it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school .
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
But one day , I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner .
And during dinner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it .
When I looked down at my plate , I saw the last chicken wing , that my foster father had given me his .
I was so happy .
I looked at him sitting next to me .
He just looked back at me very warmly , but said no words .
Suddenly I remembered my biological father .
My foster father &apos;s small act of love reminded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry , even if he was starving .
I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of starvation .
My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him .
And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice .
I took school seriously , and for the first time ever in my life , I received an academic award for excellence , and made dean &apos;s list from the first semester in high school .
( Applause ) That chicken wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) Hope is personal . Hope is something that no one can give to you .
You have to choose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
In North Korea , I made it myself .
Hope brought me to America .
But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this overwhelming freedom .
My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America .
I did not come here by myself .
I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
Many people helped me along the way to get here .
North Koreans are fighting hard to survive .
They have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
This is my message to you .
Have hope for yourself , but also help each other .
Life can be hard for everyone , wherever you live .
My foster father didn &apos;t intend to change my life .
In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the smallest act of love .
A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger , and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive .
But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph &apos;s life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Adrian Hong : Joseph , thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us .
I know you haven &apos;t seen your sister for , you said , it was almost exactly a decade , and in the off chance that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message .
Joseph Kim : In Korean ?
AH : You can do English , then Korean as well .
( Laughter ) JK : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don &apos;t think I can make it without tearing up .
Nuna , it has been already 10 years that I haven ’ t seen you .
I just wanted to say that I miss you , and I love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
And I — oh , gosh .
I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you , and I promise I will not cry again .
( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day .
And can I also make a small message to my mom ?
AH : Sure , please .
JK : I haven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pray for me and think about me .
I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
Thank you .

While you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
There are tens of thousands of these .
Okay , so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA .
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to translate ?
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
In Oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named Alice Stewart .
And Alice was unusual partly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 1950s .
And she was brilliant , she was one of the , at the time , the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians .
She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got divorced and was a single parent , she continued her medical work .
And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidemiology , the study of patterns in disease .
But like every scientist , she appreciated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
Most disease is correlated with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families .
So , what , she wanted to know , could explain this anomaly ?
Now , Alice had trouble getting funding for her research .
In the end , she got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize .
And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
Now , she had no idea what to look for .
This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of .
Had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
Had they consumed colored drinks ?
Did they eat fish and chips ?
Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
By a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant .
Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
It flew in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age , which was the X-ray machine .
And it flew in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t harm them .
Nevertheless , Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956 .
People got very excited , there was talk of the Nobel Prize , and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared .
In fact , she need not have hurried .
It was fully 25 years before the British and medical — British and American medical establishments abandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women .
The data was out there , it was open , it was freely available , but nobody wanted to know .
A child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
Openness alone can &apos;t drive change .
So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands .
So , how did she know that she was right ?
Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
She worked with a statistician named George Kneale , and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn &apos;t .
So , Alice was very outgoing and sociable , and George was a recluse .
Alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients .
George frankly preferred numbers to people .
But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong . &quot; &quot; He actively sought disconfirmation .
Different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her .
He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories .
Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right .
It &apos;s a fantastic model of collaboration — thinking partners who aren &apos;t echo chambers .
I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
Alice and George were very good at conflict .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of constructive conflict require ?
Well , first of all , it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves .
That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy .
And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love .
Because you simply won &apos;t commit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds .
Alice &apos;s daughter told me that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist , they made her think and think and think again .
&quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship .
But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest disasters that we &apos;ve experienced , mostly haven &apos;t come from individuals , they &apos;ve come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of affecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives .
So how do organizations think ?
Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t .
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict .
In surveys of European and American executives , fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise .
Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose .
Eighty-five percent is a really big number .
It means that organizations mostly can &apos;t do what George and Alice so triumphantly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
And it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them .
So how do we develop the skills that we need ?
Because it does take skill and practice , too .
If we aren &apos;t going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .
So , recently , I worked with an executive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company .
And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people .
He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help .
But when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
After all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t .
Maybe he &apos;d look stupid .
But he kept worrying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved .
In the end , Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns .
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts .
So now Joe had allies . They could think together .
And yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument , but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative , to solve the problem , and to change the device .
Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle-blower , except that like almost all whistle-blowers , he wasn &apos;t a crank at all , he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served .
But he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
And when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
And his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
They think of him as a leader .
So , how do we have these conversations more easily and more often ?
Well , the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they &apos;re prepared to defend .
It doesn &apos;t really matter what the statements are about , what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority .
I think it &apos;s a fantastic system , but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people , and way too late in life .
I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society .
The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we &apos;ve witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden .
It comes from information that is freely available and out there , but that we are willfully blind to , because we can &apos;t handle , don &apos;t want to handle , the conflict that it provokes .
But when we dare to break that silence , or when we dare to see , and we create conflict , we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking .
Open information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
But the truth won &apos;t set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it .
Openness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .

My family ate one meal per day , at night .
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
So I went to a library .
I had never seen an airplane before .
Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
We would never do that in our own countries .
But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
This is happening to us today .
And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
We have three main groups .
We have online criminals .
Like here , we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine .
And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
We actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
Here &apos;s Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia .
This is Alfred Gonzalez .
This is Stephen Watt .
This is Bjorn Sundin .
This is Matthew Anderson , Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on .
These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
The U.S. Secret Service , two months ago , froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
Mr. Jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
They &apos;re motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar .
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands — or actually , it was .
It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack .
And his answer was yes .
So how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
Well DigiNotar is a C.A.
They sell certificates .
What do you do with certificates ?
Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , SSL encrypted services , services like Gmail .
Now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
and issue rogue certificates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar .
What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
Well in Egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
Among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; &quot; FINFISHER . &quot; &quot; And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
They had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government .
The company headquarters are right here .
So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found , which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
But today , it goes beyond that .
They will tap your Internet connection .
They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
Why should I worry ?
Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
Privacy is implied .
Privacy is not up for discussion .
This is not a question between privacy against security .
It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
And do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
This , for example , is my tumble dryer .
Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .

It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone .
And I say &quot; &quot; thank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was silent for 17 years .
Because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
Well , that lasted 17 years .
I had a newspaper clipping .
&quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
And in those two years , I graduated with my first degree — a bachelor ’ s degree .
Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills .
My dad came out again .
I worked for the Coastguard , was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador .
And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; Passport , huh ?
The road turned into the jungle .
Because when I started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles .
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .

Believe me or not , I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requisite focus on climate .
And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
That culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 .
As an industrial engineer , cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur .
After founding my company , Interface , from scratch in 1973 , 36 years ago , to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets , and shepherding it through start-up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field , I read Paul Hawken &apos;s book , &quot; The Ecology of Commerce , &quot; the summer of 1994 .
In his book , Paul charges business and industry as , one , the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead humankind out of this mess .
And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth .
And I then challenged the people of Interface , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability , which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth , naturally and rapidly — not another fresh drop of oil — and to do no harm to the biosphere .
Take nothing : do no harm .
I simply said , &quot; &quot; If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ?
Unless somebody leads , nobody will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s axiomatic . Why not us ?
And thanks to the people of Interface , I have become a recovering plunderer .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .
And that became the headline of a Fortune article .
They went on to describe me as America &apos;s greenest CEO .
From plunderer to recovering plunderer , to America &apos;s greenest CEO in five years — that , frankly , was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 .
Asked later in the Canadian documentary , &quot; &quot; The Corporation , &quot; &quot; what I meant by the &quot; &quot; go to jail &quot; &quot; remark , I offered that theft is a crime .
And theft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
But I realized , for that to be true — for theft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime — there must be a clear , demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization , and is the major culprit , stealing our children &apos;s future , by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator — in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .
According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation , impact — a bad thing — is the product of population , affluence and technology .
That is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their affluence , and how it is produced .
And though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence , but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .
So the equation is conceptual .
Still it works to help us understand the problem .
So we set out at Interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it .
Paul and Anne Ehrlich &apos;s environmental impact equation : I is equal to P times A times T : population , affluence and technology .
I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T.
Now , the mathematically-minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact — a bad thing — but T in the denominator decreases impact .
So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the numerator — call it T1 — where it increases impact , to the denominator — call it T2 — where it reduces impact ?
I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution , T1 , as we practiced it at Interface , and it had the following characteristics .
Extractive : taking raw materials from the earth .
Linear : take , make , waste .
Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy .
Wasteful : abusive and focused on labor productivity .
More carpet per man-hour .
Thinking it through , I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator .
In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste-free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes , and get rid of T1 altogether , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
And that became the Interface plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
We have measured our progress very rigorously .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years .
Net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute tonnage .
( Applause ) Over the same span of time sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .
So an 82 percent absolute reduction translates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales .
This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption — so the scientists are telling us .
Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables .
The cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies .
Water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business .
Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business , which we acquired in 1993 right here in California , City of Industry , where water is so precious .
Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
We have diverted 148 million pounds — that &apos;s 74,000 tons — of used carpet from landfills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation — independent third-party certified .
We call it Cool Carpet .
And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator , increasing sales and profits .
Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home , under the brand Flor , misspelled F-L-O-R .
You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days .
It is practical , and pretty too .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint .
We &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the summit of Mount Sustainability .
We call this Mission Zero .
And this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business .
A better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
Here is the business case for sustainability .
From real life experience , costs are down , not up , reflecting some 400 million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste — the first face of Mount Sustainability .
This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface .
And this dispels a myth too , this false choice between the environment and the economy .
Our products are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspired by design for sustainability , an unexpected wellspring of innovation .
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose .
You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together .
And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .
No amount of advertising , no clever marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much goodwill .
Costs , products , people , marketplaces — what else is there ?
It is a better business model .
And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits .
There is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
But the marketplace was down 36 percent .
We literally gained market share .
We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability .
If every business were pursuing Interface plans , would that solve all our problems ?
I don &apos;t think so .
I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation , I equals P times A divided by T2 .
That A is a capital A , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .
But what if we reframed Ehrlich further ?
And what if we made A a lowercase &apos; a , &apos; suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness — more happiness with less stuff .
You know that would reframe civilization itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succeeds us : the sustainable species , living on a finite earth , ethically , happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations — that is to say , into the indefinite future .
But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable , zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020 .
We can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
And now the challenge is in execution .
And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says , &quot; If something exists , it must be possible . &quot;
( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible .
If we , a petro-intensive company can do it , anybody can .
And if anybody can , it follows that everybody can .
Hawken fulfilled business and industry , leading humankind away from the abyss because , with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere , a very dear person is at risk here — frankly , an unacceptable risk .
Who is that person ?
Not you . Not I.
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting .
But about five days later back in Atlanta , I received an email from Glenn Thomas , one of my people in the California meeting .
He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .
Because it told me , by God , one person got it .
Here is what Glenn wrote . And here is that person , most at risk .
Please meet &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Without a name , an unseen face , and knowing not your time or place , Tomorrow &apos;s child , though yet unborn , I met you first last Tuesday morn .
A wise friend introduced us two .
And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
Knowing you has changed my thinking .
For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday , somehow threaten you .
Tomorrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should .
Begin , I will .
The way the cost of what I squander , what is lost , if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child &quot; &quot; has spoken to me with one simple but profound message , which I presume to share with you .
We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
The continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
And we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it .
For you , it &apos;s your call .
Thank you .
